# Project Introduction

This repository is a project aimed at **software development** and **execution environment improvement**.
To enhance maintainability and completeness, progressive improvements are applied across versions, capturing the process in which both documentation and code evolve together.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Enhance deliverables in line with software development phases (Feasibility → Development → Deployment)
* Provide an accessible entry point by organizing requirements and project summaries
* Ensure maintainability through continuous code refactoring and version management
* Standardize configurations and structures required for web application runtime to improve compatibility/portability

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Version Management**

  * For convenient browsing on the web, the project evolution is archived in version folders `v01` to `v04` instead of branches
  * Each version includes full file updates, requirements integration, and folder structure improvements

* **Development Environment Support**

  * Preparation of execution environment using Docker and environment variables
  * Consideration for future deployment automation (CI/CD) expansion

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `doc/`

  * Documentation of software development stages
* `v01/` \~ `v05/`

  * Archived code and documentation by version
* `README.md`

  * Project introduction and execution guide

---

## 🔭 Future Directions

* **Code stabilization and test expansion**
* **Deployment support using Docker/Kubernetes**
* **CI/CD pipeline setup**
* **Enhancement of user guides and developer documentation**
